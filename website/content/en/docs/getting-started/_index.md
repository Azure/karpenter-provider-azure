  Get started with Karpenter for Azure using NAP or self-hosted deployment
---

Karpenter for Azure automatically provisions right-sized nodes for your AKS workloads, improving efficiency and reducing costs. Choose between two deployment modes to get started.

## Quick Start

Follow our [Quickstart Guide](quickstart/) for step-by-step instructions to deploy Karpenter on your AKS cluster in minutes.

## Deployment Modes

### Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) - Recommended

The managed approach where AKS handles Karpenter as an addon:
- **Zero operational overhead** - Microsoft manages everything
- **Enterprise support** - Covered under Azure support agreements  
- **Automatic updates** - Updates with AKS releases
- **Best for**: Production workloads requiring minimal management

### Self-hosted Mode

For advanced users who need full control:
- **Complete customization** - Configure all aspects of Karpenter
- **Latest features** - Access newest Karpenter capabilities immediately
- **Full control** - Manage deployment, updates, and configuration
- **Best for**: Development, testing, and advanced customization needs

Learn more about [deployment modes](../concepts/nap-vs-self-hosted/) to choose the right approach.

**Self-hosted mode considerations**: While self-hosted deployment offers maximum flexibility, it requires significant operational overhead and expertise. For most production use cases, we strongly recommend using **NAP (Node Auto Provisioning)** which provides enterprise support, automatic updates, and zero operational overhead. Review the complete [NAP vs Self-hosted comparison](../concepts/nap-vs-self-hosted/) before choosing self-hosted mode.

## Alternative Installation Methods

### Terraform

Use Terraform to automate your infrastructure:
* [Azure Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/aks/azurerm/latest): Create AKS clusters with Terraform
* [Karpenter Terraform Examples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-karpenter-terraform): Complete infrastructure as code examples

### ARM Templates

Deploy using Azure Resource Manager templates:
* Available in the [quickstart guide](quickstart/#arm-template-example) for NAP deployment
* Infrastructure as code approach for reproducible deployments

## Learning Resources
