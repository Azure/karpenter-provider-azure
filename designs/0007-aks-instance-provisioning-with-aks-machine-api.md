# Instance Provisioning and Management with AKS Machine API

**Status:** TODO

## Overview

<!-- TODO: Document the architecture and interface design for instance provisioning
and management using the AKS Machine API. This should cover:

- How the AKS Machine API mode fits alongside existing VM and VMSS modes
- High-level architecture of the Machine API provisioning path
- Interface contracts (AKSMachinesAPI, AKSAgentPoolsAPI)
- Instance lifecycle: create, get, list, delete
- AZClient structure and its role as the shared API client layer
- Integration with the operator and controller wiring
- How NodeClaim maps to AKS Machine resources
-->
