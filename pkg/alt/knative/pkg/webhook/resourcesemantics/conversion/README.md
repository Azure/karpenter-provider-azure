This code is all copied from https://github.com/knative/pkg/tree/main/webhook/resourcesemantics/conversion
at commit fdbc0b5adde7 (this is the commit used by our knative dependency v0.0.0-20240910170930-fdbc0b5adde7
as of Oct 23, 2024).

The only changes were made to reconciler.go to support `crd.spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig.url` in addition
to `crd.spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig.service`.

Look for the sections that start with `// AKS customized` to understand the changes.

Also note that the zz_generated.deepcopy.go isn't currently actually autogenerated it's just copied from upstream.
